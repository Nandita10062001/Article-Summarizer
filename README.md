# üì∞ Article-Summarizer

This project encompasses two distinct approaches to summarization: one based on **TextBlob** and **newspaper** for extractive summarization, and another using **T5** from the Hugging Face Transformers library for abstractive summarization.

1. **News Summarizer:**
   - Extracts titles, authors, publication dates, and key points from any news article.
   - Analyzes the sentiment of the article's content.
   - Simple and user-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter**.

2. **Abstractive Summarizer with T5:**
   - Generates human-like summaries using the **T5 Transformer model**.
   - Handles long texts with efficient tokenization and inference using PyTorch.
   - Interactive GUI with scrollable text input and output fields.
